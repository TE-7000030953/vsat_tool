# Vulnerability Survey Automation Tool (VSAT)

The purpose of this tool is to automate the vulnerability survey process, reducing the time and effort previously spent on conducting the survey manually. I.e., the tool automates the process of searching the Make file, checking object file in Make files and searching configuration settings in kernel cxd (configuration) file. It extracts file paths from patch links, downloads webpage content, and verifies configurations.
